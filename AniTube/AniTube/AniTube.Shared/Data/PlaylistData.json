The Federation collapsed, but the Space Revolutionary Army was unable to invade the Earth in the aftermath of the colony drop. Fifteen years have passed. The year is now After War 0015, and a New Federation has sprung up on Earth to restore order. In space, the colonial leaders have been rebuilding their own forces as well. By chance, fifteen-year-old Garrod Ran has discovered an old Federation mobile suit, the Gundam X, and now he uses it to help out the Vulture ship Freeden in its struggle to keep the powers that be from repeating the mistakes of the past.\r\n\r\nGenres:  Subbed, Adventure, Drama, Mecha, Sci-Fi, Shounen","title":"After War Gundam X","filmsListId":["/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-001?id=38385","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-002?id=38386","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-003?id=38387","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-004?id=38388","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-005?id=38389","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-006?id=38390","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-007?id=38391","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-008?id=38392","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-009?id=38393","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-010?id=38394","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-011?id=38395","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-012?id=38396","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-013?id=38397","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-014?id=38398","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-015?id=38399","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-016?id=38400","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-017?id=38401","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-018?id=38402","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-019?id=38403","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-020?id=38404","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-021?id=38405","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-022?id=38406","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-023?id=38407","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-024?id=38408","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-025?id=38409","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-026?id=38410","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-027?id=38411","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-028?id=38412","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-029?id=38413","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-030?id=38414","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-031?id=38415","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-032?id=38416","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-033?id=38417","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-034?id=38418","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-035?id=38419","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-036?id=38420","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-037?id=38421","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-038?id=38422","/Anime/After-War-Gundam-X/Episode-039?id=38423"]},{"id":"http://kissanime.com/Anime/Agatha-Christie-no-Meitantei-Poirot-to-Marple","genres":"Subbed,Historical,Mystery","otherNames":"アガサ・クリスティーの名探偵ポワロとマープル; Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple; ","isFavorite":false,"publishedDate":"2013-07-23T00:00:00Z","popularityIndex":2381,"imagePath":"http://kissanime.com/Uploads/Etc/7-23-2013/8073505455064.jpg","description":"Young Mabel West is the daughter of mystery writer Raymond West, who wants her to lead a normal life.
